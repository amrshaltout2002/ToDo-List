✅ To-Do List App (Python CLI)

This is a simple To-Do List app built in Python. It lets you add tasks, mark them as complete, and view the current list — all through a text-based menu.

## 🧠 Why I Made This

I created this project to practice basic Python concepts like:
- Working with lists and dictionaries
- Writing clean, reusable functions
- Handling user input and input validation
- Building a simple console-based user interface

It’s a fun and practical way to learn the building blocks of Python while making something useful.

## 🚀 Features

- 📝 Add tasks to a list  
- ✅ Mark tasks as complete  
- 📋 View all tasks with their status (✔ or ❌)
